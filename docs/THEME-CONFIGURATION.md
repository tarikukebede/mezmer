# Theme Configuration Guide

This guide explains how theme selection, theme files, and runtime mode behavior are configured in this library workspace.

## Scope

Use this document for:

- selecting and switching workspace themes
- understanding generated files and configuration state
- scaffolding a custom theme
- validating theme contracts

This guide also covers how theming is validated in CI for AI-first workflows.

For token definitions and consumer import examples, see `docs/THEMING.md`.

## Configuration Files

- `ai/contracts/index.json`: source of truth for available theme entries (`id`, `contractPath`, `cssPath`).
- `ai/contracts/themes/*.contract.json`: contract metadata for each theme.
- `ai/theme.schema.json`: JSON schema that validates theme contract structure.
- `ai/theme.active.json`: current workspace-selected theme and preferred mode metadata.
- `src/themes/active.css`: generated import file that points to the selected theme stylesheet.
- `src/themes/default.css`, `src/themes/slate.css`: built-in theme token files.

## Theme Selection Flow

1. Run `pnpm theme:list` to inspect available themes from contracts.
2. Run `pnpm theme:apply --theme <theme-id> [--mode light|dark|system]`.
3. The script updates:
   - `src/themes/active.css` to import the selected `src/themes/<id>.css`
   - `ai/theme.active.json` with `themeId`, `mode`, and `updatedAt`
4. Components pick up tokens via `src/styles.css` and Tailwind semantic utilities.

## Runtime Mode Behavior

`--mode` is stored as workspace metadata in `ai/theme.active.json`.

It does not automatically apply `.dark` at runtime. Dark mode still depends on your runtime class strategy (Tailwind `darkMode: ['class']`), so the host app or preview shell must control the `.dark` class.

## Typography And Component Style Tokens

Themes support styling beyond color. In addition to color and radius tokens, the library consumes optional typography and component-shape tokens, including:

- `--mz-font-sans` and `--mz-font-mono` for typeface control
- button sizing and rhythm tokens (`--mz-button-height`, `--mz-button-padding-x`, `--mz-button-padding-y`)
- button typography tokens (`--mz-button-font-size`, `--mz-button-font-weight`, `--mz-button-letter-spacing`)
- button elevation tokens (`--mz-button-shadow`, `--mz-button-shadow-hover`)

When creating a custom theme with `pnpm theme:create`, copy and tune these tokens in the generated CSS so components remain visually polished out of the box.

## Create A Custom Theme

Run:

```bash
pnpm theme:create --id brand-x --from default
```

This scaffolds:

- `src/themes/brand-x.css`
- `ai/contracts/themes/brand-x-theme.contract.json`
- a `themes` entry in `ai/contracts/index.json`

After creation, apply it with:

```bash
pnpm theme:apply --theme brand-x
```

## Validation And Quality Gates

Run contract validation after theme changes:

```bash
pnpm validate:contracts
```

Theme-related CI checks in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` include:

- `pnpm theme:list` to ensure registry metadata remains readable
- `pnpm test:scripts` to verify theme script integration behavior
- `pnpm validate:contracts` to confirm theme contract/index consistency
- standard lint/type/test/build quality gates before release

Docs publishing CI in `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` builds VitePress and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages on `main`.

## AI Context And MCP Compatibility

Theme metadata is intentionally machine-readable for AI systems:

- `ai/contracts/index.json` provides the theme registry
- `ai/contracts/themes/*.contract.json` defines theme contract metadata
- `ai/theme.active.json` records workspace-selected theme state

Mezmer now includes a repository-local MCP server.

For theme workflows, that server can expose the active theme state, theme registry metadata, and theme contract details without requiring tools to inspect the repository manually.

Run it with:

```bash
pnpm mcp:server
```

For a broader overview of the MCP surface, see `docs/MCP-SERVER.md`.

Recommended release checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm tsc --noEmit
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Consumer Packaging Notes

Published consumers usually import a concrete theme directly:

```tsx
import '@tarikukebede/mezmer/styles.css';
import '@tarikukebede/mezmer/themes/default.css';
```

`src/themes/active.css` is primarily a workspace/development convenience for switching themes locally.
